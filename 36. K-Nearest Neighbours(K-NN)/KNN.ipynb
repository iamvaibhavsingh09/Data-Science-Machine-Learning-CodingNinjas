    "In K-fold cross validation, the training data is randomly split into K different samples (or folds). One of the sample is taken to be the validation set and the model is fitted on the remaining (K - 1) samples. The accuracy of the model is then computed. The same process is repeated K times, each time taking a different sample of points to be in the validation set. This results in K values for test error and these values are averaged out to obtain the overall result.\n",

    "Using this way, we can choose the optimal value of K using cross validation. If the value of K is very less, for eg, say 1, it will lead to overfitting and will result in formation of complex decision boundaries. On the the hand, if the value of K is very high, we are basically underfitting and not actually taking class of neighbours into consideration. In this case, we predict the class of the testing sample from the majority class of the overall training data rather than from the majority class given by the neighbors.\n",

Backward Elimination is the technique used for doing feature selection, using which we will keep few features and get rid of other features from all the features intially in the dataset. In this technique, we will traverse over all the features and obtain the accuracy score by keeping this feature and next time, by removing this feature. If the accuracy of the model improves on removing this feature, then we will exclude this feature, otherwise we will keep this feature and likewise do the same thing for all the features."
